If there is any one in some degree friendly to Copernicus and the
lights of the Samian philosophy, who finds this difficulty only, that
he doubts how it can happen, supposing the earth to perform again and
again her course among the planets through the ethereal plains, that
the moon should keep so constantly by her side, like an inseparable
companion, and at the same time fly round and round the actual orb
of the earth, just like a faithful dog which goes round and round
his master on some journey, now running in front, now deviating to
this side or that, in ever-varying mazes, let him look at the planet
Jupiter, which, as this telescope shows, certainly carries in its train
not one such companion only, like the earth, as Copernicus showed, but
actually four, that never leave it, though all the time hastening each
in its own orbit.
